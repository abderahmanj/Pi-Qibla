so, a question arose where he was asking how we got the info needed to calculate declination. considering we are saying that this device does not rely on cellular or wi-fi (i transcribed the questions he was asking lol): 

look up table?
is it residing memory?
is it a large file, bcz you need it for many locations, right?
how do you get this info?
is it residing on the device or do you have to connect to a network?
so you need a connection right?
so do you have the whole globe in memory here?
so i have to connect to a network right?
ok but where is the data residing?
somewhere in the cloud?
--Im asking a simple question
is it stored in the memory for the whole globe?
so you need to connect to something right?
well then how do you do it?
--people will ask
once you download it and have it, then dont have to worry about it?
--this is a very elementary question
--if you are claiming that it is self contained then it has to correspond with you claim
