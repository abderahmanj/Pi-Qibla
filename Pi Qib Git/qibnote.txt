"The dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt disconnects the bluetooth from the ttyAMA0, this is to allow us access to use the full UART power available via ttyAMAO instead of the mini UART ttyS0."

---In the absence of any strong local magnetic fields, the sensor readings should reflect the magnetic field of the earth (between 20 and 60 micro-Teslas). 
When the sensor is held level, by calculating the angle of the magnetic filed with respect to the X and Y axis, the device can be used as a compass.

Computing a Compass Heading:
To convert the microTesla readings into a 0-360 degree compass heading, we can use the atan2() function to compute the angle of the vector defined by the Y and X axis readings. The result will be in radians, so we multiply by 180 degrees and divide by Pi to convert that to degrees.

** Run sudo raspi-config Choose option 7 from the menu, then option A6. That lets you disable pixel-doubling.

To Do List:
while true(
get data from compass and gps
--compass -> geopy -> degrees from true north
--degrees from true north, gps -> function -> direction to qibla based on the current gps + degrees from true north
--print direction to point on screen
)

tried adding "heading" to code. compass readings were erratic. used many different tutorials to fix but were unable. used: https://bitbucket.org/shigeru_kawaguchi/adafruit_lsm303_for_rpi)

we stopped after a few hours. will research and under stand -->(https://github.com/praneshkmr/node-lsm303/wiki/Understanding-the-calibration-of-the-LSM303-magnetometer-(compass))
	``	and on wednesday we will add a code to calibrate, remove all the exerimental code and try again.

"However, note that 'heading' isn't computing what I hoped."

"Regarding to the heading data, it is using Python's arctangent for X and Y and it supposed to give in range of -180 to 180. Since tangent becomes infinity at 90 degrees, may be it is causing division by zero error." 

"I found a fix to the heading issue I think.
In the function readMagneticHeading, it does:
magData = self.readMagnetics()

Instead if I do:
magData = self.readMagneticsGauss()

It gives me a better reading from -180 to 180."

added this: coords = [coords[0]*(math.pi/180), coords[1]*(math.pi/180)]
referred to: https://github.com/Knio/pynmea2
and added direction conditions:
if msg.lat_dir == "s":
	latval = latval * -1
print(msg.lon_dir)
if msg.lon_dir == "W"
	longval = longval * -1
ie. msg.lat_dir pulls directional info for latitude from string

Added conditional statement to that converts the coordinate direction into a positive/negative value so it could be used in the qibla equation for the correct degrees to Mecca from true north.
