geomag is a module which you import, and when you use it then it runs the script/code inside of the module

-------------------------
1. why did we make the pi-qibla server?

server basically works like the client sends a request and the server responds, so the client sends a request for the compass info and server runs all the python stuff we coded and returns the compass information
-------------------------
2. what is localhost?

well it is a webserver meaning it runs on the web, right now it runs on our local machine which is referred to as localhost
-------------------------
3. program code receives GPS data once, then loops the rest of the code every second?

yes
-------------------------
4. what do i start the flowchart with if i am describing the algorithm

>> hmm okay first thing we get gps data and save it, then we start server then client requests info to display to the html page
>> so it requests http://localhost/?info
>> once server receieves request it does all the stuff we did in the code
>> then it returns the result and that is what you see on the screen
-------------------------
4.5 how come it's able to run on the local machine without the web?

>> you can say its a test server
>> yeah were just running locally because the gps and compass is attached locally
-------------------------
5. since we are displaying firefox in fullscreen, is there a way to display in fullscreen but remove the scroll bars?

hmm idk google that
-------------------------
6. how do i explain the constraint of displaying the compass dial on firefox versus  an independent displaying of the compass dial (idk if that makes sense)?

>> well.... theres many ways to show a compass....you can do it like we did or you can create cpp gui
>> not really a constraint just a choice
-------------------------
7. is cpp gui, C++ gui?

yeah
